what you know:

1. go back through every exercise and write down every word and symbol/character that I used
Make sure character list is complete

Next to each character, write it's name and function
Look it up online

Memorize the list of charcters and their functions

exercise 1: 
print: prints out what you would like to say
octothorpe = pound = hash = mesh (#)

exercise 3: 
+ plus
- minus
/ slash
* asterisk
% percent
< less than
> greater than
<= less than equal
>= greater than equal

exercise 4: 
_ = underscore character that gives imgainary space between characters in a variable

exercise 6:
f - format or f string - 
.format - they can input some value that is already defined within the program into something by saying print(f"hi i am {blahblah}")

exercise 9: 
\n - line breaker

exercise 10: 
\ - escape; to escape double or single quotes 
escape sequences: 
\\ = backlash (\)
\' = single quote (')
\" = double quote (")
\a = ASCII bell (BEL)
\b = ASCII backspace (BS)
\f = ASCII formfeed (FF)
\n = ASCII linefeed (LF)
\N{name} = charached named name in the unicode database
\r = Carriage Return (CR)
\t = horizontal tab (tab)
\uxxxx = character wth 16bit hex value xxxx (u" string only)
\Uxxxxxxxx = character with 32bit hex value xxxxxxxx
\v = ASCII vertical tab (VT)
\ooo = characted with octal value ooo
\xhh = character with hex value hh

exercise 11: 
input () - inputting a value that already has a variable
end '' - tells print to not end the line with a newline character and got to the next line

exercise 12: 
input("Name?")

exercise 13: 
sys import.argv
- import = add features from python feature set 
argv - holds the argument you pass to your python script when you run it 

ex 14: 
prompt - gives something like a bullet before an input

ex 15: 
txt = open(filename)
-> that opens files up easily

ex16: 
close - closes file 
read - reads file content, you can assign result to a variable 
readline - reads just one line of a rext file 
truncate - empties the file 
write('stuff') - wrties "stuff" to the file
seek(0) - move the read/write location to teh beginning of the file
